this algorithm is implemented  according to the thesis An efficient context-free  parsing algorithm  
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.15.614&rep=rep1&type=pdf
and we use the algorithm to do thai word check
we rewite the thai word grammer into context free grammer
the txt file rule.txt rule_low.txt terminals.txt Nonterms.txt all together contains the rules
rules are written in this form 
tcc:help7,co,vo4,help8
the rules are adapted from the thesis thai word segmentation using GLR paring technique, and statistical language model
http://digi.library.tu.ac.th/thesis/siit/0228/04chapter3.pdf
you should see the master degree thesis, because it'is self-contained, and the rules are in the references.
